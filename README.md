# 100x Mid-Capstone — Personalized LoRA Perfume Creative Generation  

🚀 **Mid-Capstone Project (100xEngineer)**  

This project explores how **personalized generative AI** can merge with **product rendering**.  
I trained a **LoRA model** on my own face and a **perfume dataset** to generate **realistic headshots** and **branded ad-style creatives**.  

The workflow was built with **ComfyUI**, leveraging **Flux diffusion models** for **text-to-image**.
